## Challenge Scenario 

You have started a new role as a Data Engineer for TaxiCab Inc. You are expected to import some historical data to a working BigQuery dataset, and build a basic model that predicts fares based on information available when a new ride starts. Leadership is interested in building an app and estimating for users how much a ride will cost. The source data will be provided in your project.

<!-- Task and Solution -->
# Task 1: Clean Your Training Data

1. Type "BigQuery" in the search bar to enter BigQuery.
2. Open query editor and enter the following:

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxirides.<TABLE_NAME> AS
    SELECT
        (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS <FARE_AMOUNT_COL>,
        pickup_datetime,
        pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
        pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
        dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
        dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
        passenger_count AS passengers,
    FROM `taxirides.historical_taxi_rides_raw`
    WHERE
        RAND() < 0.001                          -- Expected to only take less than [0.001 * (1 Billion)] rows
        AND trip_distance > <TRIP_DISTANCE>
        AND fare_amount >= <FARE_VALUE>
        AND pickup_longitude > -78
        AND pickup_longitude < -70
        AND dropoff_longitude > -78
        AND dropoff_longitude < -70
        AND pickup_latitude > 37
        AND pickup_latitude < 45
        AND dropoff_latitude > 37
        AND dropoff_latitude < 45
        AND passenger_count > <PASSENGER_COUNT>
    ```

    > **Note** 
    > <br>Remember to replace:
    > <br>`<TABLE_NAME>`with the "Table Name" given in the task at the left panel.
    > <br>`<FARE_AMOUNT_COL>` with the "Fare Amount" given in the task at the left panel.
    > <br>`<TRIP_DISTANCE>` and `<PASSENGER_COUNT>` each with the "Number" given in the task at the left panel.
    > <br>`<FARE_VALUE>` with the "Example Value" given in the task without '$' sign ($_) at the left panel.

    Run the query. Wait for the query to complete creating, then proceed to the next task.

# Task 2: Create A BQML Model

Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL taxirides.<MODEL_NAME>
TRANSFORM( 
    * EXCEPT(pickup_datetime),
    ST_Distance(ST_GeogPoint(pickuplon, pickuplat), ST_GeogPoint(dropofflon, dropofflat)) AS euclidean,
    CAST(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime) AS STRING) AS dayofweek,
    CAST(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS STRING) AS hourofday
)
OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['<FARE_AMOUNT_COL>'], model_type='linear_reg') AS
SELECT * FROM `taxirides.<TABLE_NAME>`
```

> **Note** 
> <br>Remember to replace:
> <br>`<TABLE_NAME>`with the "Table Name" given in the task at the left panel.
> <br>`<FARE_AMOUNT_COL>` with the "Fare Amount" given in the task at the left panel.
> <br>`<MODEL_NAME>` with the "Model Name" given in the task at the left panel.

Run the query. Wait for the query to complete running, then proceed to the next task.

# Task 3: Perform Batch Prediction On New Data


```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxirides.2015_fare_amount_predictions AS
SELECT * FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL taxirides.<MODEL_NAME>, (
    SELECT * FROM `taxirides.report_prediction_data`
))
```

> **Note** 
> <br>Remember to replace `<MODEL_NAME>` with the "Model Name" given in the task at the left panel.

Run the query. Wait for the query to complete creating, then proceed to the next task.
