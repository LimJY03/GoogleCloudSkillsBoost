## Challenge Scenario 

You are part of an international public health organization which is tasked with developing a machine learning model to predict the daily case count for countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

As a junior member of the Data Science team you've been assigned to use your data warehousing skills to develop a table containing the features for the machine learning model.

<!-- Task and Solution -->
# Task 1: Create A Table Partioned By Date

1. Type "BigQuery" in the search bar to enter BigQuery. In the "Explorer" tab, click the 3 dots beside your project ID > **Create Dataset**.
2. In the "Create Dataset" pop-up, at "Dataset ID", paste the "Dataset Name" provided in the task. Leave the others as default.
3. Click **CREATE DATASET** > **Go To Dataset**.
4. Open a query editor and enter the following:

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE <Dataset_Name>.<Table_Name>
    PARTITION BY date OPTIONS(partition_expiration_days = 360) AS
    SELECT * 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_govt_response.oxford_policy_tracker`
    WHERE alpha_3_code NOT IN ('GBR', 'BRA', 'CAN', 'USA')
    ```

    > **Note**
    > <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_Name>` and `<Table_Name>` with your "Dataset Name" and "Table Name" given in the task.

```

# Task 2: Add New Columns To Your Table

Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

```sql
ALTER TABLE <Dataset_Name>.<Table_Name>
ADD COLUMN population INT64,
ADD COLUMN country_area FLOAT64,
ADD COLUMN mobility STRUCT<
    avg_retail FLOAT64,
    avg_grocery FLOAT64,
    avg_parks FLOAT64,
    avg_transit FLOAT64,
    avg_workplace FLOAT64,
    avg_residential FLOAT64
>
```

> **Note**
> <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_Name>` and `<Table_Name>` with your "Dataset Name" and "Table Name" given in the task.

# Task 3: Add Country Population Data To The `population` Column

1. Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE <Dataset_Name>.pop_data_2019 AS
    SELECT country_territory_code, pop_data_2019
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_ecdc.covid_19_geographic_distribution_worldwide`
    GROUP BY country_territory_code, pop_data_2019
    ORDER BY country_territory_code
    ```

    > **Note**
    > <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_Name>` with your "Dataset Name" given in the task.

2. Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

    ```sql
    UPDATE `<Dataset_Name>.<Table_Name>` AS t0
    SET population = t1.pop_data_2019
    FROM `<Dataset_Name>.pop_data_2019` AS t1
    WHERE CONCAT(t0.alpha_3_code) = CONCAT(t1.country_territory_code)
    ```
    > **Note**
    > <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_Name>` and `<Table_Name>` with your "Dataset Name" and "Table Name" given in the task.

# Task 4: Add Country Area Data To The `country_area` Column

Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

```sql
UPDATE `<Dataset_Name>.<Table_Name>` AS t0
SET t0.country_area = t1.country_area
FROM `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.country_names_area` AS t1
WHERE t0.country_name = t1.country_name
```

# Task 5: Populate The `mobility` Record Data

```sql

SET
    t0.mobility.avg_retail = t1.avg_retail,
    t0.mobility.avg_grocery = t1.avg_grocery,

# Task 6: Query Missing Data in `population` & `country_area` Columns

Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country_name
FROM `<Dataset_Name>.<Table_Name>`
WHERE population is NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT DISTINCT country_name
FROM `<Dataset_Name>.<Table_Name>`
