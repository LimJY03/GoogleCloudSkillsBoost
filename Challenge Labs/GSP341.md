## Challenge Scenario 

One of the projects you are working on needs to provide analysis based on real world data that will help in the selection of new bicycle models for public bike share systems. Your role in this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can predict average trip durations for bike schemes using the public data from Austin's public bike share scheme to train and evaluate your models.

Two of the senior data scientists in your team have different theories on what factors are important in determining the duration of a bike share trip and you have been asked to prioritise these to start. The first data scientist maintains that the key factors are the start station, the location of the start station, the day of the week and the hour the trip started. While the second data scientist argues that this is an over complication and the key factors are simply start station, subscriber type, and the hour the trip started.

You have been asked to develop a machine learning model based on each of these input features. Given the fact that stay-at-home orders were in place for Austin during parts of 2021 as a result of COVID-19 you will be working on data from previous years. You have been instructed to train your models on data from `<Training_Year>` and then evaluate them against data from `<Evaluation_Year>` on the basis of Mean Absolute Error and the square root of Mean Squared Error.

As a final step you must create and run a query that uses the model that includes subscriber type as a feature, to predict the average trip duration for all trips from the busiest bike sharing station in `<Evaluation_Year>` (based on the number of trips per station in `<Evaluation_Year>`) where the subscriber type is 'Single Trip'.

<!-- Task and Solution -->
# Task 1: Create A Dataset To Store Your Machine Learning Model

1. Type "BigQuery" in the search bar to enter BigQuery. 
2. In the "Create Dataset" pop-up, at "Dataset ID", choose a name that you want, this name will be `<Dataset_ID>`. Leave the others as default.
3. Click **CREATE DATASET** > **Go To Dataset**.

# Task 2: Create A Forecasting BigQuery Machine Learning Model

Think of a name for the first model, this name will be `<MODEL_1_NAME>`. Then, open query editor and enter the following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_1_NAME>
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes,
    address AS location
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON trips.start_station_name = stations.name
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Training_Year>
```

> **Note**
> <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_ID>` and `<Training_Year>` with your own "Dataset Name" and the "Training Year" given in the task.

Run the query. Wait for the query to complete creating, then proceed to the next task.

# Task 3: Create The Second Machine Learning Model

Think of another name for the second model, this name will be `<MODEL_2_NAME>`. Then, open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_2_NAME>
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Training_Year>
```

Run the query. Wait for the query to complete creating, then proceed to the next task.

# Task 4: Evaluate The Two Machine Learning Models

1. Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse, mean_absolute_error
    FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_1_NAME>, (
        SELECT
            start_station_name,
            EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
            EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,

        FROM bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips AS trips
        JOIN bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations AS stations
        ON trips.start_station_name = stations.name
        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Evaluation_Year>
    ))

    SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(*) AS trips
    FROM bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips

    GROUP BY start_station_name
    ORDER BY trips DESC
    ```
    > **Note**
    > <br>Remember to replace `<Evaluation_Year>` with the "Evaluation Year" given in the task.
