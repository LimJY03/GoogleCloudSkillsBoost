## Challenge Scenario 

You have started a new role as a junior member of the Data Science department Jooli Inc. Your team is working on a number of machine learning initiatives related to urban mobility services. 

You are expected to help with the development and assessment of data sets and machine learning models to help provide insights based on real work data sets.

<!-- Task and Solution -->
# Task 1: Create A Dataset To Store Your Machine Learning Model

1. Type "BigQuery" in the search bar to enter BigQuery. 
2. In the "Create Dataset" pop-up, at "Dataset ID", choose a name that you want, this name will be `<Dataset_ID>`. Leave the others as default.
3. Click **CREATE DATASET** > **Go To Dataset**.

# Task 2: Create A Forecasting BigQuery Machine Learning Model

Think of a name for the first model, this name will be `<MODEL_1_NAME>`. Then, open query editor and enter the following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_1_NAME>
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
    duration_minutes,
    address AS location
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations
ON trips.start_station_name = stations.name
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Training_Year>
```

> **Note**
> <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_ID>` and `<Training_Year>` with your own "Dataset Name" and the "Training Year" given in the task.

Run the query. Wait for the query to complete creating, then proceed to the next task.

# Task 3: Create The Second Machine Learning Model

Think of another name for the second model, this name will be `<MODEL_2_NAME>`. Then, open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_2_NAME>
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', labels=['duration_minutes']) AS
SELECT
    start_station_name,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
    subscriber_type,
    duration_minutes
FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Training_Year>
```

Run the query. Wait for the query to complete creating, then proceed to the next task.

> **Note**

# Task 4: Evaluate The Two Machine Learning Models

1. Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse, mean_absolute_error
    FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_1_NAME>, (
        SELECT
            start_station_name,
            EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
            EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM start_time) AS day_of_week,
            duration_minutes, address AS location
        FROM bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips AS trips
        JOIN bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations AS stations
        ON trips.start_station_name = stations.name
        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Evaluation_Year>
    ))
    ```

    > **Note**
    > <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_ID>`, `<MODEL_1_NAME>` and `<Evaluation_Year>` with your own "Dataset Name", "Model 1 Name" and the "Evaluation Year" given in the task.

    Run the query. Wait for the query to complete creating, then proceed to the next step.

2. Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse, mean_absolute_error
    FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_2_NAME>, (
        SELECT
            start_station_name,
            EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,

        FROM bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips AS trips
        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Evaluation_Year>
    ))
    ```

    > **Note**
    > <br>Remember to replace `<Dataset_ID>`, `<MODEL_2_NAME>` and `<Evaluation_Year>` with your own "Dataset Name", "Model 2 Name" and the "Evaluation Year" given in the task.

# Task 5: Use The Subscriber Type Machine Learning Model To Predict Average Trip Durations

1. Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT start_station_name, COUNT(*) AS trips
    FROM bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Evaluation_Year>
    GROUP BY start_station_name
    ORDER BY trips DESC
    ```
    > **Note**
    > <br>Remember to replace `<Evaluation_Year>` with the "Evaluation Year" given in the task.

2. Check the query result, copy the first name in `start_station_name` column, this station name will be `<START_STATION_NAME>` for the next query.
3. Open a new query editor (or clear the codes in old editor) and enter the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(predicted_duration_minutes) AS average_predicted_trip_length
    FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL <Dataset_ID>.<MODEL_2_NAME>, (
        SELECT
            start_station_name,
            EXTRACT(HOUR FROM start_time) AS start_hour,
            subscriber_type, duration_minutes
        FROM bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips
        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_time) = <Evaluation_Year>
        AND subscriber_type = 'Single Trip'
        AND start_station_name = '<START_STATION_NAME>'
    ))
    ```

    > **Note** Remember to replace:
    > <br>`<Dataset_ID>`with your own "Dataset Name".
    > <br>`<MODEL_2_NAME>` with your own "Model 2 Name".
    > <br>`<Evaluation_Years>` with the "Evaluation Year" given in the task.
    > <br>`<START_STATION_NAME>` with the station name that you copied just now.

    Run the query. While waiting for evaluation result, proceed to the next step.
