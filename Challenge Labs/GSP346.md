<!-- Lab Description With Link -->
In this lab, you will test your skills to view, filter, and sort data in Looker. You will also be expected to save Looks, add them to a dashboard, add them to a board, and schedule regular delivery of data.

## Challenge Scenario 

You are a data analyst intern for a private plane and helicopter rental company. For your first assignment, your new manager has tasked you with creating multiple dashboards to present at a company meeting. Specifically, you are required to use the provided FAA datasets to determine the best locations to set up new rental hubs.

Your manager wants the answer to the following questions:

* Which states and cities have the most airports with heliports?
* What is the facility type breakdown for the states with the most airports?
* What are the airports and states with the highest percentage of flight cancellations with over 10,000 flights?
* Where are the busiest, joint-use major airports that have control towers and what are their associated codes?
* What are the origin and destination airports with the smallest average distance between them?

<!-- Task and Solution -->
# Task 1: Create Looks

## Look 1: Most Heliports by State

Take note at the number highlighted with yellow at "Limit the results (rows) to the top _ states", you will need to use it to substitute `<COUNT1>` in this solution.

1. Click **Explore** > **FAA** > **Airports**.
2. Click **City**, **State** and **Count**.
3. At the "Data Bar" at the right, change the Row Limit to `<COUNT1>`.
4. Make sure that the **Airports Count** column is in descending order, otherwise click the column header until the arrow points downwards.
5. Click the **Filter by Field** button beside **Facility Type**. Then in the "Filter" section, choose `is equal to` and choose **HELIPORT**. Don't add this dimension into the query.
6. Click "Run" and see if the visualization section looks like the one shown in the task. Make sure the results are visualized in "Table".
7. Click the settings icon beside the "Run" button, then click **Save** > **As a Look**. Then, title it according to your task. For example: `Top _ Cities With Most Heliports.`

    > **Note**
    > <br>After saved, click the "Looker" icon to go back to the main page. This will reset the query section so that you can start working on the next look.

## Look 2: Facility Type Breakdown

Take note at the number highlighted with yellow at "Limit the results (rows) to the top _ states", you will need to use it to substitute `<COUNT2>` in this solution.

1. Click **Explore** > **FAA** > **Airports**.
2. Click **Count** and **State**.
3. At the "Data Bar" at the right, change the Row Limit to `<COUNT2>`.
4. Click the **Pivot Data** button beside **Facility Type**, make sure that it is in descending order (the arrow points to the left), otherwise click the column header until the arrow points to the left.
5. Click "Run" and see if the visualization section looks like the one shown in the task. Make sure the results are visualized in "Table".
6. Click the "settings" icon beside the "Run" button, then click **Save** > **As a Look**. Then, title it according to your task. For example: `Facility Type Breakdown for Top _ States`

    > **Note**
    > <br>After saved, click the "Looker" icon to go back to the main page. This will reset the query section so that you can start working on the next look.

## Look 3: Percentage Cancelled

1. Click **Explore** > **FAA** > **Flights**.

        ```

    * Format: **Percent**
      <br>Decimals: **3**

        ```markdown
        Percentage of Flights Cancelled
        ```
    Then click save.
5. Click the **Filter by Field** button beside **Count** (under **Flights**). Then in the "Filter" section, choose `is greater than` and type `10000`.
6. Click the "settings" icon beside Flights **Counts** and Flights Details **Cancelled Count** at the database, and choose **Hide from Visualization** for both.
7. Make sure that the **Percentage of Flights Cancelled** column is in descending order, otherwise click the column header until the arrow points downwards.
8. Click "Run" and see if the visualization section looks like the one shown in the task. Make sure the results are visualized in "Table".
9. Click the "settings" icon beside the "Run" button, then click **Save** > **As a Look**. Then, title it as: 

    ```markdown
    States and Cities with Highest Percentage of Cancellations: Flights over 10,000
    ```

    > **Note**
    > <br>After saved, click the "Looker" icon to go back to the main page. This will reset the query section so that you can start working on the next look.

## Look 4: Smallest Average Distance

Take note at the number highlighted with yellow at "Limit the results (rows) to the top _ states", you will need to use it to substitute `<COUNT3>` in this solution.

1. Click **Explore** > **FAA** > **Flights**.
2. Click **Flights** > **Origin and Destination**.
   <br>Click "Add" button beside **Custom Fields** and click on **Custom Measure**.
3. In the "Edit Custom Measure" pop-up, set the following fields:

        ```markdown
        Average Distance
        ```

    * Name:

        ```markdown
        Average Distance (Miles)
        ```
    
    * Filter: *Leave it*

    Then, click **Save**.

4. Click the **Filter by Field** button beside **Average Distance (Miles)** (under **Custom Fields**). Then in the "Filter" section, choose `is greater than` and type `0`.
5. At the "Data Bar" at the right, change the Row Limit to `<COUNT3>`.
6. Make sure that the **Average Distance (Miles)** column is in ascending order, otherwise click the column header until the arrow points upwards.
7. Click "Run" and see if the visualization section looks like the one shown in the task. Make sure the results are visualized in "Table".
8. Click the "settings" icon beside the "Run" button, then click **Save** > **As a Look**. Then, title it according to your task. For example: `Top _ Airports With Smallest Average Distance`

    > **Note**
    > <br>After saved, click the "Looker" icon to go back to the main page. This will reset the query section so that you can start working on the next look.
