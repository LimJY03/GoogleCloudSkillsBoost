## Introduction to the Course

This course provides an introduction to the tools and technologies google cloud offers to work with large data sets and then integrate that data into the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning life cycle.

Data and AI have a powerful partnership:

* Data is the foundation of every application integrated with AI. 
    * Without data there's nothing for AI to learn from. 
    * No pattern to recognize and no insight to glean. 
* Conversely without AI, large amounts of data can be unmanageable or under utilized.

Google has developed the infrastructure to ingest manage and serve high quantities of data from their applications. AI and ML have been integrated into those products to make the user experience of each even more productive.

Google Cloud offerings can be broadly categorized as:

* Compute
* Storage
* Big Data
* Machine Learning

The main focus of this course is on big data and ML.
