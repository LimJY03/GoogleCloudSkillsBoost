    "# Vertex Pipelines: Qwik Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines help you automate and reproduce your ML workflow. Vertex AI integrates the ML offerings across Google Cloud into a seamless development experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, models trained with AutoML and custom models were accessible via separate services. Vertex AI combines both into a single API, along with other new products. Vertex AI also includes a variety of MLOps products, like Vertex Pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to create and run ML pipelines with Vertex Pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Are ML Pipelines Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in, first understand why you would want to use a pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building out a ML workflow that includes processing data, training a model, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and model deployment. Each of these steps may have different dependencies, which may become unwieldy if you treat the entire workflow as a monolith. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin to scale your ML process, you might want to share your ML workflow with others on your team so they can run it and contribute code. Without a reliable, reproducible process, this can become difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "With pipelines, each step in your ML process is its own container. This lets you develop steps independently and track the input and output from each step in a reproducible way. You can also schedule or trigger runs of your pipeline based on other events in your Cloud environment, like when new training data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK to build scalable ML pipelines.\n",
    "* Create and run a 3-step intro pipeline that takes text input.\n",
    "* Create and run a pipeline that trains, evaluates, and deploys an AutoML classification model.\n",
    "* Use pre-built components for interacting with Vertex AI services, provided through the google_cloud_pipeline_components library.\n",
    "* Schedule a pipeline job with Cloud Scheduler."

    "* **Kubeflow Pipelines**: This is the SDK used to build the pipeline. Vertex Pipelines supports running pipelines built with both Kubeflow Pipelines or TFX.\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Pipeline Components**: This library provides pre-built components that make it easier to interact with Vertex AI services from your pipeline steps.\n",

To set up a pipeline, use the `@dsl.pipeline` decorator, give the pipeline a name and description, and provide the root path where our pipeline's artifacts should be written. By artifacts, it means any output files generated by our pipeline. This intro pipeline doesn't generate any, but our next pipeline will.\n",

    "    1. The output of `product_task`. Since this step only produces one output, we can reference it via `product_task.output`.\n",

The `thresholds_dict_str` is something we'll define when you run your pipeline. In the case of this classification model, this will be the area under the ROC curve value for which we should deploy the model.

    "        * In this pipeline, we're passing the data via a BigQuery table URL.\n",
    "    * `AutoMLTabularTrainingJobRunOp` kicks off an AutoML training job for a tabular dataset. \n",
    "        * We pass a few configuration parameters to this component, including the model type (in this case, classification), some data on the columns, how long we'd like to run training for, and a pointer to the dataset. \n",
    "        * Notice that to pass in the dataset to this component, we're providing the output of the previous component via `dataset_create_op.outputs[\"dataset\"]`.\n",
    "    * `ModelDeployOp` deploys a given model to an endpoint in Vertex AI. \n",
    "        * There are additional configuration options available, but here we're providing the endpoint machine type, project, and model we'd like to deploy. \n",
    "        * We're passing in the model by accessing the outputs of the training step in your pipeline.\n",
    "* This pipeline also makes use of conditional logic, a feature of Vertex Pipelines that lets us define a condition, along with different branches based on the result of that condition. \n",
    "    * Remember that when we defined the pipeline we passed a `thresholds_dict_str` parameter. \n",
    "        * This is the accuracy threshold we're using to determine whether to deploy our model to an endpoint. \n",
    "    * To implement this, make use of the `Condition` class from the KFP SDK. \n",
    "        * The condition passed in is the output of the custom eval component you defined earlier in this lab. \n",
