# Launching into Machine Learning

> *The course begins with a discussion about data: how to improve data quality and perform exploratory data analysis. We describe Vertex AI AutoML and how to build, train, and deploy an ML model without writing a single line of code.*
>
> *You will understand the benefits of Big Query ML. We then discuss how to optimize a machine learning (ML) model and how generalization and sampling can help assess the quality of ML models for custom training.*

## Introduction to the Course

In [this course](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/8), we will learn to:

* Describe how to improve data quality.
* Perform exploratory data analyitics.
* Build and train AUtoML Models using Vertex Ai.
* Build and train AutoML Models using BigQuery ML.
* Optimize and evaluate models using performance metrics.
* Create repeatable and scalable training, evaluation and test datasets.
