83,Cat,4,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,White,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Charlie was rescued by dogs! A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Charlie to be loved his whole life :)",5,2

He was terrified of people but gradually warmed up to her after she fed him some food & he would wait outside her house at the same time every day for food. One day he didn't show up. When he finally showed up again, he had a large terrible wound on his neck. He was in so much pain and had tears in his eyes. She brought him to the vet and found out his wound had become infested with maggots. The vet treated him and she brought him home and nursed him back to health for over a month. The wound has now completely healed but unfortunately she is unable to keep him. He is estimated to be 10 years old but is still strong & healthy. We are unsure about his breed.

He grew up with 2 cats and another small dog. he loves cats however it takes him awhile to respond well to new dogs.

Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him.

With broken hind legs. Probably knocked by a vehicle. He was crying but no passer-by cared to rescue him. My friends from the neigbourhood and I decided to check him out after hearing his cry for a couple of days and noticed that he was an abandoned puppy with serious injuries. We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping ""Oreo"" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted ""Oreo"" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found ""Oreo"" in some where. Now, we have to put Oreo up for adoption again. I really hope that a kind person with love and care for animals will adopt Oreo and give him a comfortable live. He has gone through many hardship.

Meet Bidi Budu Bubu Boy. He was rescued on May 14th from the dog catcher. The rescuer took him back from the pound less than 4 hours he was sent there. He was destined for a forever home. Unfortunately, the adopters don't want him anymore and due to his nature of lovingness, he can't be left at the road side. Nobody will ever know the boy's history but am sure he went through some bad times in order for him to be caught by the dog catches. The Bidi Budu Bubu Boy is well-behaved, doesn't bark unnecessarily, doesn't mess up the garden, bite shoes or any of that sorts. So, whatever may be, you will end up with a loving darling of a boy. Please provide a loving home for him as he will make you a very happy person. Ps. Would prefer people who allow us visitation rights as we want to ensure the puppies are taken care off. Pss.

He is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt him as we have too many cats. It would be great if the person can also adopt his siblings - Inky and Pinky, although this is not a must. We prefer to give him up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks. He needs to be kept indoors, as He is very young and would not know how to survive outdoor. Being a new environment, he might also runaway if kept outdoors. He is very good with our cats.

370,Dog,5,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,100,"Gabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy, estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up. That was in March . Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",5,4

418,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,White,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,200,"This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

Her 2 kittens are available for adoption too, and their photos are shown below. Rescuer Note: Kittens are not ready to be neutered yet until they are 6 months old. It is very important to neuter them when they are ready, as this will prevent them from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant.

A nice lady found me in Nilam Terraces in Puchong sometime in end April. She asked the neighbourhood guards about me but no one knew who I belonged to and the guards said I'd been wandering around for 2 weeks. The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me. So my carer who has a fondness for anime decided to call me Chibi (""small"" in Japanese) and help me look for a new home. I may be small in stature (only 6kgs!) but will readily bark to alert you to someone at the door! I love to be snuggled - belly rubs are the best! I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?"" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to partially cover vaccination, deworming, heartworm test/prevention, tick + flea prevention and skin treatment. 4. If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :)",6,3

I found him near death and with severe, chronic mange, ticks, ulcerated wounds, an ear abscess and severely malnourished. After a few weeks of patient, loving kindness and veterinary attention he is now a very healthy, lively dog with a gentle nature. Brim is a special dog with an unusually gentle nature. It appears Brim may have been abused before being thrown into the street. He is shy around strangers and becomes nervous with loud noises. He would NOT be suitable as a guard dog. His temperament is too soft but he will make a great family pet and so I'm looking for a genuinely loving person or family willing to give Brim a lot of love and freedom to run around. Ideally this would be in a quiet part of the country or in a home with a large garden. I have started training him. He's now house trained, sits and comes on command and will leave the room when told to do so. He is also leash trained and will walk to heel.

Unfortunately for us, we are unable to provide him the attention that he deserves as we have full time jobs as well as 2 other dogs, a bird and 3 guinea pigs at home to care for! He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo.

747,Cat,4,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Brown,White,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,100,"Shiro is a white lilac-pointed kitty who looks a bit like Taylor Swift. She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",26,3

906,Cat,12,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Cream,White,Large,Medium,No,No,Healthy,0,"READ BEFORE DECIDING! Mio is an active, playful, and talkative male cat. He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio. Thank you ;)",4,3

1090,Cat,2,American Curl,Male,Cream,White,Medium,Long,Yes,No,Healthy,400,"♥ Male, 8 weeks old, white cream point with blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Christian is both a rambunctious player and a shy little love-dove! He is careful of new situations as much as he tests them, and once he warms up, he can skip over at his humans better than the fastest bunny. He's our favourite boy and it took a lot of heart to place him for adoption - heavy purrer (he'll sound like an engine!) and especially loves being stroked and kissed while carried. He can be a lap-cat when relaxing (not while he's busy playing of course, he'll jump off). Also enjoys being shown around the house. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Christian must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",14,3

Faithful and I have always been pretty closed as if we have known each others for a long time. As if we are born to be bonded. In fact, our first meeting was just three weeks ago. Everytime we meet, she would wave her tail excitedly as if shes trying to tell me “Hi! I've missed you!” I often walk to the guardhouse looking for her and she would sprint towards me and keep licking my knee. Slowly, I've noticed I wasnt the only “chosen one” as she would literally do that to every passerby. 😒 Ms. Faithful is a little bit timid, but that doesn't change her love and friendliness towards people. Being that, she has developed good reputation among the neigborhood. Everyone loves her. HOWEVER, recently the other stray animals have troubled the neighborhood, leaving them no choice but to ask for the services from MPK. How can we leave such kind dog to be caught and put to sleep?!

He dislikes to be trapped in cage/carrier or else he will meow, whine or growl incessantly. He also terrified of riding in the car, he seems to be fear & not enjoy the experience. Kenzo is loving, funny and super friendly boy. He is a clingy & spoilt cat with adorable attitude. Active and playful but will collapse after 5-10mins of playing, maybe because he is kinda fat. He has a weird habit of grinding his teeth which is cuteeeee that might fix your mood swing. Litter trained. His light blue eyes are very captivating and could melt your heart instantly. Adopters must agree to keep him indoors or in a secure yard & not to put him in cage unless it's for quarantine/ transportation. Adoption fee RM50 is to make sure new owner is serious to take care of him. Looking for cat lover that can give he a forever home where he deserves more love, care and attention. Location : Horizon Hills, Johor Bahru. Please don't hesitate to message me regarding Kenzo adoption. Thank you. Whatsapp/SMS only, strictly NO CALLS",3,1

She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough.

If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary.

She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten.

I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it! And I’m not a big eater, so I’m pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy can’t keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I can’t.

1543,Cat,24,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,Yellow,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"His name is Zee, he is 2 years old and very healthy but not always palyful. I have been keeping him for 2 years, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley. THANKS!",5,2

Just like my sister, I am adventurous and very loving (we got this trait from our mummy). We love people and being around people, and playing with people and snuggling up to people, anything people related! Will you be my furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!",2,2

He's healthy and he's a quiet type, un-neutered, 1 month old, and his coat is similar to a dark chocolate bar till he was about 3 weeks of age. Now it's greyish black! whenever he hears a foreign noise he does growl and puppy bark. Could be a good watch dog and companion! :) Just shower Puma with love and comfort, he'll definitely give back more. PUMA'S BIRTHDAY IS ON THE 21ST DECEMBER ! P/s : I recommend spaying/neutering Puma after the age of 2 years to avoid any health/growth abnormalities, which explains the pet being un-neutered. Conditions for adopting Puma: *Adopter must be attentive *RESPONSIBLE. Adopter should be willing to bare the expenses of future health probs (not just give up one day and leave/abandon the dog elsewhere) *Adopter must be caring, loving & thoughtful of their pet/pets *Like all dogs, Puma needs exercise so daily walks or plays during the week would be strongly necessary *Adopter must groom Puma occasionally *Adopter must be willing to vaccinate,de-worm & neuter Puma accordingly. *Adopter should be active in FB for the adopter to post photo's or updates about Puma to see how Puma is doing. *I may visit Puma un-occasionally at the adopter's place from time to time. *Adopter should bare in mind that once they adopt a pet, their responsibilities are forever so think well. I do not want Puma to end up abandoned in some place because the adopter can't be responsible enough. Please take good care of Puma.",8,1

The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling.

1897,Dog,60,Spitz,Male,Black,White,Small,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,".: I as the owner decided not to give up on Zorro, so he has been with me all these while..however, im in need of favor and am looking for a temporary fosterer ...tops 3 months or less..preferably someone with landed property and very gentle with Zorro as he is quite a scaredy cat..he is afraid of strangers and large dogs but he is very sweet once he knows you. preferably someone staying nearby seputeh, brickfields, midvalley , bangsar area as i would be dropping by to pick him up for grooming or replenish his food. Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather. Like now its blazing hot so i will send him for grooming before giving him to the fosterer. If there is anyone interested let me know and of course i would need to scan through the fosterer as Zorro means a lot to me. If you are planning to get a dog for a pet but not sure if you can handle well this is your chance to have a pooch at ur place temporary to see if dogs suitable for u.. Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion. I would appreciate much if I could send him to his new home if there is any kind-hearted soul out there willing to take him and make him part of your family.",2,4

Being touched by that scene, we decided to help this poor fur family. We tried our best to find adopters. She was the last one left. She was finally adopted by a family who just moved to penang 3 months ago. We were happy as we thought that she has finally found a permanent home. However, we were wrong. Unfortunately, this family was forced to move out from the landed house they rented recently as the house owner has found a potential buyer. This family tried their best to find a new landed house with affordable rental. Again, luck was not with them. They had no choice but to have to move into an apartment.

I offered to take it in to PAWS. Not knowing PAWS was closed on Wednesdays we then took the pup to the VET who confirmed she is a girl, healthy looking and between 7 to 10 days. We have been looking after her since Wednesday afternoon. She has been feeding very well and her urine and motion looks very healthy. She is very happy with her little tail wags and wriggling around the box. However, we live in a condo and due to personal/business life we are unable to look after or raise a dog. However, we do not want her to be put down or sent to shelter where she will most likely not survive. The poor little girl needs someone to hand raise her and give her the love and care she needs. If the right home for her needs financial support for her injections/vet/spade I am happy to help. **Update - it's been 5 days since I posted this and she is a super happy dog... lots of tail wags, she is very healthy...

2035,Cat,8,Siamese,Male,Black,White,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"(Urgent) This boy lives in the garage of my condo. I regularly catch the strays living around to neuter and vaccinate them. I did so with that boy last week. He is neutered and got his first vaccine shot. I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him. I am not getting him out of the streets to have him get back there in a few years.",4,1

She is a good, alert watch dog, does not simply bark except for times when stranger is near the house. Understand basic commands like 'sit down', 'come here ' and when to start eating her food, does not bite things or shoes Advantage of adopting adult dog vs puppy: - Adult dogs are mature and character shown, as not all dogs have the character to watch a house (welcoming to all strangers without being alert), however Jolly is an alert watch dog that does not give in to people she is not familiar with. A good watch dog only works well if is not tie up or cage up whole day. - Adult dogs do not chew/ destroy things, not hyperactive or run around as compare to puppies - Female dog does not pee all around the house. They have set boundary for 'pee & poo' area - Adult dogs are more loving, easy to command as compared to puppy, and at this age, they would sit near to you just to watch you doing your things (they love companionship) Me and my husband love her very much, she has kept us feeling safe every night and she is a good company.

2124,Cat,3,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Gray,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Hello, Max-A-Million here! ♥ My rescue story is a rough one. I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc). This is for his long-term welfare. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Max-A-Million home, please drop me an email or text at my number.

2127,Cat,2,Calico,Male,Black,Yellow,Medium,Medium,No,No,Healthy,0,"I just found and caught a stray kitten at the back of my kitchen. It was raining heavily and the little kitten was all wet and hungry. I waited for hours to see any sign of the mother cat but there is none. So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage. I am still unable to hold the little kitten as he/she is still afraid of human contact. So, I am unable to know the little kitten's gender yet. My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human. I believe that with tender loving care and patience, the little kitten will turn out to be a wonderful companion for the potential adopter. So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call . Thank you. 1/3/16 Its been a week since I rescued this kitten and I found out that she's really a female and so I named her ABBIE. She's still wary of strangers but she's comfortable with me to the extend that she allows me to carry her on my lap and clip her nails. I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end. So I am changing his name from Abbie to Aggie. 😊 9/3/16 Aggie is doing very well and quite playful. Hope he will get a new family soon.",12,4

I'll be moving overseas so I would like to look for a new home for her. Preferably a place where she can have access to the outdoors. She's an outdoorsy cat. She's very curious and confident. Has no fear of anything and very playful and active. She's a tomboy so she has no dainty manners. She can probably get along well with dogs and active cats but if you have an existing cat who is gentle, jumpy and scared of stuff I wouldn't recommend her. Ginger will cause your gentle cat a lot of distress. She is about 6 years old. She's blind in one eye because she fell off my balcony as a kitten but it doesn't impair her in any way. She loves people but doesn't really like cuddles. She'll only rub against your legs when she wants food. She is litter trained. Hates pine litter though. She enjoys running around at full speed and enjoys being chased. She eats raw chicken and regular cat kibble. She's well mannered when it comes to human food.

Initially we had someone who adopted her but, soon discovered that the owner is not a suitable candidate to have her. As guardians to this puppy, my husband and i felt that Marley needs a better environment and family. We have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever of our own that we rescued 2 years ago. We follow and practice the techniques of Cesar Millan and we are looking for suitable owners who are familiar with dogs to adopt Marley. Bob Marley is a 6 months old puppy; very playful, intelligent, alert and is a good watch dog. She likes to jog along with the handler. After awhile of getting to know you, you can walk or jog with her without a leash. As an advice, do bring along a leash anyhow. Golden Retriever puppies are hyper but will mellow down as it gets older from age 1 to 2 onward. Still, all dogs have their unique personality which you will come to know in time. This breed needs a cool environment due to its coat. They do well with owners who have big compound and lots of shades. For owners who prefer their dogs living indoor with them, this breed is also suitable for it, provided she can go out 2 to 3 times a day to do her business on grassy land. If you are unsure of this breed, do Google and study about this breed. We love this dog and we sincerely hope to find the best owner for her. Grooming is moderate.",5,1

She should not jump and run for 2 months. Nondi remains to be a very active kitten, very independant. She is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt her as we have too many cats. We prefer to give her up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter her and also take her for regular vet checks. She needs to be kept indoors. For her condition now she should be caged, BUT she hates the cage. So right now she stays in a room but is caged at night. This is only coz we want the fracture to heal. She is very good with our cats and dogs, but mostly she is on her own. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters.",6,1

She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her ""home"" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her ""potty"", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs). She is a freedom loving girl. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this darling a second chance. Thank you!",7,3

I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",6,1

Milky is now under reserved. :) ---- When first found her, she's a tiny cat with serious fungus and eye infection. After 1 month of treatment, she's recovering and in healthy again. So, we'd like to find a good home for this sweet little girl. How special she is? Well, like all kittens, she is playful, naughty and need attention. But, something other than that, she's a super talkative cat! She greets you when you're home; meowing goodnight when she's sleepy. Don't try to poke her while she's sleeping. She'll non-stop grumbling at you!! With these amazing characters, we believe she'll find a permanent home. Therefore, if you think she can be your companion, please contact us for adoption. **For serious adopter only!",4,1

We had her neutered. as after a week of food she went straight on heat, and attracted some very devoted toms, one is still her closest friend. Perhaps we should have had her put down, as we knew we were only here for a few weeks - but she is such a wonderful, affectionate and intelligent creature, we simply couldnt. Please can someone give her a home - she is clean in the house, a joy to have around, a little vocal - her voice is still a bit strange, possibly some Siamese from somewhere - a little needy - with the most amazing huge aquamarine eyes.

Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

2598,Dog,2,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,White,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Update: Just to clear the doubts, Milo is a MIXED breed. I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!",2,2

2626,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Yellow,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Indoor cats: I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation. Good quality food, vet visits, etc will need to be budgeted.",2,4

Blue kitten!' That's my fav color! its hard to find a blue kitten/cat nowadays unless they are British Short hair or Russian blue. the reason i want to let her go even i really2 want to keep her are: 1. am a student 2. am a wife 3. am a missy to my mom, shes a strokee 4. we got 6 cats already nothing much i know bout this BlueCHEESE ;). 24 hours with her just tell me she: 1. never meows 2. not scared when being bath 3. so manja, likes to purrr, likes to be hugg 4. most of her body covered with muscle, NO fat. so she is quite heavy 5. the coat is so pretty especially under the lights as the coat starts to look like Velvet. it shines and is really2 soft when touch 6. she has 2 big round cooper eyes 7. she got a wrinkle tail just like wrinkle fries ;) 8. she is SOLID BLUE but there is a small white patch under the tummy~ very low white The person that adopt her must SPAY her. its a must! i will ask from time to time as i do not want her to get into a wrong home.

To be honest, we have fallen a little in love with him, but we already have 2 cats and have allergies, so we can't keep him. Please, if you are looking for a loving, playful and smart kitten to be part of your family, contact us and come and see him. Otherwise we'll have to take him to Paws :( ----- Story: We found an orange tabby kitten in Damansara Utama. He was hiding from another mother cat who was being very aggressive because she was near her kittens. We think he might be looking for his mother and just went near this cat, hoping for someone to take care or sayang him. He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name ""NUR MAISARAH"" written on it. We are looking for his owner, or someone to adopt him. Please contact us by 13 May or we'll have to send him to Paws :( Thank you!",9,2

We brought him home loved, feed, cleaned and took care of him very well. Now he is VERY healthy and happy and VERY active. No injuries at all. We named him ""Duke"" :) He is a joy of a cat. Very smart and full of happiness. Plus, he is very funny and creative when playing with us :) He knows well how to use the litter box. To conclude, We are traveling 7th May, after few days!!. And this beautiful kitten can't be safe near streets, he needs a home. So, can you please give Duke a home? Can you take care of him? More info: He is around 2 months old. Crossed breed, and I just assumed from his eyes and ears that he is Javanese though! Because he looks a lot like he is mixed Javanese with domestic or with oriental! De-flea and all necessaries done already (Neutered not yet). White + cream color Very handsome with big blueish/greenish eyes. We already have wet & dry food, will be provided. And we will give him a shower, before handing him to you. Thanks :)",5,1

In Penang A lot of people will think that female dogs will dirty the place or cause male dogs to come when they have period. In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more.(The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2. Spay it when it's 6 months old if you do not want to see abandoned puppies. 3. Treat the puppy with love and make it be part of your family.",4,2

The car was about to reverse and run over her when we spotted her and ran to stop the car from moving. We took her home and fed her as she was malnourished when we found her at 1 month old. She seemed to be eating well and seemed very happy but then 2 days later we found out she had contracted the Parvo virus. Complicated by her malnourishment she was in dire need of medical attention and was hospitalized and put on drips for 5 days. After she was released from hospital she had gotten over the worst of the parvo but still very weak and needed special care. Even through all the pain she never failed to wag her tail and smile at us whenever we were with her. She was a real fighter! We fed her high quality kibble to make sure she would bulk up but the virus seemed to have restricted her growth. Now after 2 months of intensive care, good food and love, Lucy is now a healthy, happy, slender puppy who shows no signs of the struggle she had in her early life. She loves to play and snuggle with you on the floor and is still the same happy go lucky girl she always was, always ready to greet you with a smile and a tail wag. She's very quite and friendly to people and animals alike. She's now looking for a home where she can grow into a well loved pup! If interested PLEASE do give us a call or email us.

Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at.

It wouldn't be fair on them to keep little Steve so I am hoping that we can find him a really loving family who will shower him with only the best attention and love. He's had a difficult life so far, please let us find him a safe and warm home!!! If you're a person with a lot of love to give this little one, please contact me ().",4,1

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy.

3409,Dog,6,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"This here is Molek! (story background) We found her, her siblings (all 6 of them) and her mummy under an abandoned car in front of a 99 speed mart in Bandar Sunway. Our family came over daily to feed the mummy dog as our initial plan was to wait till all of them are old enough to eat kibbles and put them up for adoption and neuter the mummy dog. However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too! And a major plus point is she's up to date with all her vaccines and she is neuter (save u the trouble)! We're located in klang valley pj area, very close to Sunway Pyramid! Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. The best way to get me would be via telephone! Thank you for viewing ^_^",3,2

3518,Dog,54,Pomeranian,Male,Brown,Cream,Small,Medium,Not Sure,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"Found this lost Pomeranian in my neighborhood. He is a male and around 4 to 5-year-old. Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes ""Running Away"" its lifetime profession?",12,2

Now we are moving abroad and out of our three dogs we can only take one with us. Therefore we are looking for a loving home for her. With her shiny black coat she looks quite impressive, but she is a gentle creature when it comes to people. We have always felt very safe with her around. Tinka has attended dog trainings and knows the basic commands. She loves to learn new things and show her skills, and if she gets a praise for it - even better! although she makes an excellent guard dog she spends a great deal of the day being lazy and just being happy to be around someone. Her ideal family takes her out on walks and makes her part of the family (one of her happy days was when she ""convinced"" me that she was allowed to watch TV on the couch with me). In return she will be very loyal and watch out for her family. She doesn't like cats and needs some time to get used to other dogs. She was fine with our other two dogs, and I never had a problem taking her to the vet or leaving her at the kennel when we went away, but there are a few dogs in our neighborhood that she does not approve of. We currently allow her to be inside the house as well as in the garden, so please don't keep her in a small cage or on a chain all day long.

Joos has been to hikes to waterfalls and top of mountains and she responds very well to adventure in the jungle. Because of her dominant behaviour and strong character only experienced adopters will be considered as she needs a strong leader that she can rely on.

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

3754,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Gray,Small,Short,Yes,No,Minor Injury,0,"He is called Jellybean because he has always been small in size but strong in character and very, very sweet. He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy.""

That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most.

3817,Cat,12,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Gray,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",12,2

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

Yesterday night we met Bambi. She ran out from the roadside very quickly to the middle of the road and our car nearly hit her. She's a super beautiful tiger striped girl with innocent big round eyes. Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training. But she's a very manja girl and love to stick with human, when she can't see any people around her she will feel insecure and cry. But when you're with her, she will just be very quiet and sit or sleep beside you. A very sweet little baby! Adopter need to be patient with her at the beginning as she's still a little baby now, she can be trained to be independent after a period. We feel that Bambi is more suitable to keep indoor at this point since she don't pee and poo anywhere and loves to have companion... Interested to adopt?

3985,Dog,5,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,Brown,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Little Hailey had a rough beginning to her life. Hailey was rescued about 2 months ago in Desa Sri Hartamas. She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family . Adopter must agree to spay her in February before her first heat. If you are keen on giving Hailey her forever loving home, please contact Kin at.",3,4

4021,Dog,12,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"Update 27 Oct : on Saturday 25 Oct , Boy went to Central Park, Desa Park City and he was having a lot of fun running and walking around the lake for about 2 hours. He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him. May God bless you.",10,3

Guess what, now he's running although his broken leg isn't functional anymore. He plays fetch! He runs so fast and he is friendly with people. He's a lover. He's a nice and polite dog. He's not a naughty dog at all! He is an amazing dog. But since I'm a Muslim and I have limitations of taking care of him, and to us, we think he deserves a better home and family to take care of him for the sake of his happiness.

Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Coco is a sweet-pea and has a true inherited Ragdoll nature where she goes limp if carried! She can likely be taught to be a lap-kitten, enjoys strokes and being baby-talked. She is the best climber and learns things real quick! Loves toys (especially feathered ones) and adventure - she also has an odd-obsession with watching us cleaning out the litter box (and sometimes getting in there to ""help"" us). ♥ She's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Coco must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Spaying is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",11,2

Luckily for the puppy he managed to dodge the in coming car just in time. The puppy was so shaken and i decided to bring him home for temporary care, he was so hungry that he finish up all the food in just seconds and of course after the meal it was time to take a good and nice hot bath. I was unable to care for this puppy for long time as i'm staying at a apartment and i have a 9 months old female mongrel dog with me, which i rescue her 6 months ago when her owner decided to leave her alone by the road side. To my surprise my female dog seems to enjoy the male puppy company, well maybe they share the same fate as a mongrel and stray around by the roadside and so my female dog decided to treat the small male puppy nice. The puppy was a very active dog, he likes to follow me around where ever i go and when i keep him in a cage or when he does not see me around for a short period of time he whine and whine until he fall asleep. Anyway i sincerely hope that someone can adopt the male puppy and give him a nice warm home.. . anyone who is interested,sincere and serious to give the puppy a new home can contact me anytime, please find below my detail.thank you",2,1
4077,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Yellow,Small,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Hello. Meet Tookins, who reinvents herself from a traumatised stray to a techno savvy kitten. She is about 3-4 weeks old. She is an adorable Calico with a stumpy tail that wiggles when she is super happy. I found her in the middle of a busy road, too scared to move. Luckily she was not hurt. Just shocked. Even from that first encounter, I knew that she is one lovable kitty. Her hobbies include playing with anything that moves, glows or just plain old bits of paper. She loves cuddling to her Mrs Bunny, her bff. Tookins is a natural-born cuddler and a lap kitty. Also a shoulder kitty. Out of all her long list of repetoires, she is also a Youtube and Netflix bingewatcher. She loves teenage movies with good villains in it. Tookins has been checked by the vet and she has been given a clean bill of health. She has been dewormed and deloused (Advocate). She cannot be vaccinated yet as she is so tiny according to the vet. Tookins eats boiled tuna, Whiskas Kitten pouch food and Royal Canin Kitten. She is fully toilet trained and at the moment stays indoors at all times for health and safety reasons. As you can see, she is well loved by my family. As a kitten rescuer and fosterer though, I am willing to share my love for her with a responsible forever family who will care for her unconditionally. If I found her a good home, I can rescue more kittens in need. There is no adoption fee. All I am asking is for Tookins' future mom or dad to: 1. NEUTER her as soon as she can be safely neutered. 2. Make sure her VACCINATIONS are up-to-date 3. Provide her with everything she needs to stay safe, comfortable and happy for the rest of her life. So if you are looking for a quirky, fun-loving, cuddly and not to mention super adorable wee fluff, look no further, for Tookins is your kind of kitten. Please do not hesitate to send me a message. I will then give you a questionaire to be filled in. Thank you. Nini",13,3

We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal. All Klover needs is a good home :)",2,4

She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home.

Keep in contact.Please send me picture of her every now and then.I want to be assured that she's fine and growing well. 3. Be absolutely sure that you will commit to her before adopting. 4. I will try to converse with you a bit before giving her because I want to know the adopter's background. About the kitty : This is a female kitten. She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers.",8,1

He was suffering from skin problem (yeast infection). He was treated at the vet and has recovered from yeast infection. He used to scratch and chew himself until he is injured. He still requires continuous monitoring and treatment for his hind legs as he may have met an accident before we foster him and he is currently undergoing holistic treatment. He is allergic to certain food, hence, he has limited choices in food but he can take certain kibble. He is friendly with humans and dogs, except when he thinks the human is trying to apply antiseptic cream on him when he was injured back then. He growled and snapped as he was in pain. Hence, it is best that he does not go to a home with very young children as they may accidentally harm him and he would snap. He is toilet trained and stays indoor. He hardly barks.

4483,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,Cream,Small,Short,Not Sure,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"We found this amazing little guy abandoned in the streets of Mont Kiara at about 4 weeks old, alone and injured. We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks!

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily.

So Winnie the Pooh was the inspiration for my name. Just like Mr.Pooh, I'm adventurous and very loving! I can't stop wagging my tail when i hear my name being called! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!",2,2

This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is called Pepa or Pepper, another spice name. She's pretty chill kitten, doesn't run around much, but is pretty friendly and likes to play with her 'twin', Orey. The difference between her and Orey is she has brownish color on her legs. Orey can already eat wet food and a bit of dried food, so food wise, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can, maybe get one pack of kitten milk and feed her that until it finishes. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.",2,1

Adopter can choose to send him back to us for spaying at 8 months old or prove to us that neutering is done by showing the incision part & the vet written proof and we will refund the balance after paying/deducting the neutering fee. • we will send to adopter's house. • to be kept indoor. • allow us to visit once in a while. • vaccinations to be follow up. • medical needs to be given if needed in future. • no caging/on leash for long hours. • return to us/inform us if he were to be given to another person. • updates via whatsapp/email/Facebook/Instagram/house visit from time to time. • to be fed on proper food with proper nutrition meant for dogs. • love him as a part of the family.

Much appreciated. ------------------------------------ His story : Was rushing to an appointment and saw this lil one hiding under a red car at an area that we are familiar with. Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",7,3

We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home.

4887,Cat,0,American Shorthair,Female,Black,Cream,Small,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Hey everyone! So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.",4,4

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- Her story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. G3 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",8,3

4973,Dog,2,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,White,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"She's sweet and easy to warm up to pup. Active and likes to engage in play, but is reserved to start. She bonds very well with adults and children alike, and is more likely to bond one-on-one than in groups. Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her. We would love to keep Josephine but our apartment does not allow for pets, and it is far too small a space for her size. She has gotten dewormed and done one wash for fleas and ticks, with other vaccinations and a neutering pending with vets advice, as they suggest we wait for her to get a little older.",5,0
